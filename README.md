## General

This project is used to create tweets for meetup events like
[Web Engineering Aachen](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Aachen/)
based on the talks, location and time.

The script will create tweets for different time with time-related messages:

* At the beginning of the month for the event
* At the beginning of the week for the event
* At the day of the event

The script should be used in a `daily` cron job.
